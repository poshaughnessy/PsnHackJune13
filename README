DucksPhys is a 3D mini game aimed at 7-12 year-olds that teaches them the 
concepts of physics. Students can explore the laws of physics by balancing 
weights in form of ducks using their hand gestures which are being read by 
the Leap Motion Controller.

Please note this is a hackathon entry created in less than 2 days - so the
